            We are a prop-tech startup at the intersection of smart hospitality
            and wellbeing. We aim to revolutionise the usage of under-utilised
            spaces. Our tech-enabled ecosystem allows us to convert, launch and
            operate decentralised rooms seamlessly. Pop & Rest enable 24/7
            access and different uses - from taking a nap to therapy, quiet work
            and overnight stays - for nearby employees, remote workers and
            travellers. Each of our spaces offers the ultimate wellness and
            quality of sleep experience.
